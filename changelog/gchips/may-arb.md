# Bootloader Anti-Rollback bump ahead

This update will install helluvaOS {{.release_name}} ({{.tag}}) with {{.security_patch_date}} security patch, fixes critical bugs, and improves the performance and stability of your {{.device_model}}.

Please refrain from installing Magisk or any other modifications unless you perform a full ROM sideload after the update. This procedure ensures that the new bootloader is correctly applied to both slots, safeguarding against potential issues. Beginning with the May release, the Pixel 6 and 8 series have an incremented Anti-Rollback counter in the bootloader.

For obtaining the full ROM, checkout [go/latestbuild{{.codename}}](https://get.hentaios.com/latestbuild?codename={{.codename}})
